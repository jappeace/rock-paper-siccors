This is a bot that will play rock paper siccors
games according to this [protocol](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Szetty/BotServer/1.0.0#/).

It was built on saturday exploration day for jappie
his streams where the clojure langauge was being explored
. In line with showing off some game theory.

This is a work in progress.
I at least want to implement ficticious play and finish up beat last.

## Usage
Nix shell will pull in lein in whatever version I used.
It also makes ngork available.

C-c in emacs on functions appears to do things
